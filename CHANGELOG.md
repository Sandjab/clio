# Changelog

## [0.21.0] — 2026-05-28

Minor release closing the **v0.21 spec-alignment trilogy** — the parser now accepts the three type-system extensions `docs/LANGUAGE_SPEC.md` has documented since v0.1: `Dict<K, V>`, `Optional<T>`, and numeric/string constraints (`int(min, max)`, `float(min, max, precision)`, `str(min)`). Three feature PRs squash-merged on `main` (PR #76 Dict, #77 Optional, #78 constraints), each gone through CI + Gemini review (10 inline comments total, 8 applied — 2 pushback as out-of-scope refactor candidates). Net test count `1136 → 1188` (+52: 6+5+8 parser, 3+3+5 IR, 6+7+7 cross-target smoke). Notable Gemini catches: an idiomatic-Go fix (no `*` on slices/maps which are already nilable), and a HIGH-severity bug where `Optional<str(max=200)>` silently dropped its `max_length` Field kwarg because `_field_from_schema` did not unwrap the `anyOf` Optional shape.

### Added

- **`Dict<K, V>` — homogeneous string-keyed map type.** Parser accepts `Dict<str, V>` in CONTRACTs, STEP TAKES / GIVES, and FLOW TAKES / GIVES. Renders to: `dict[str, V]` (Pydantic — python/mcp-server/langgraph/claude-skill targets), `map[string]V` (Go target), `{"type": "object", "additionalProperties": V}` (JSON Schema — claude-cli and claude-skill schemas, MCP tool inputSchema/outputSchema). v0.21 constraints (enforced at parse time with clear errors): (1) `K` must be `str` — `Dict<int, V>`, `Dict<enum(...), V>`, etc. are rejected (JSON object keys are strings; Go's `encoding/json` only natively supports string-keyed maps); (2) `FOR EACH` over a `Dict` is forbidden — model as `List<{key: str, val: V}>` upstream if iteration is needed. Nested generics inside the value are supported: `Dict<str, List<int>>`, `Dict<str, {a: int, b: str}>`, `Dict<str, ContractRef>`. Documented as cookbook recipe #25.
- **`Optional<T>` — nullable T.** Renders to `T | None` (Pydantic), `*T` (Go pointer), `{"anyOf": [<T>, {"type": "null"}]}` (JSON Schema). v0.21 semantics: the field is REQUIRED at the schema level (must be present, just possibly null) — Pydantic v2's distinction between `T | None` (must be present, can be None) and `T = None` (missing-allowed with default). CLIO has no syntax for "missing-allowed" today; default at the runtime layer instead. Nests with `List` / `Dict` / records / enums uniformly (`Optional<List<int>>`, `List<Optional<r>>`, `Dict<str, Optional<int>>` all parse). `_json_type_to_go` / `_json_type_to_python` walkers recognise the `anyOf: [<T>, null]` shape and emit `*T` / `T | None` respectively (shared helper `_anyof_optional_inner` keeps the two walkers in sync); slices and maps stay bare (already nilable in Go). Documented as cookbook recipe #26.
- **Extended primitive constraints** — `str(min=N)`, `int(min=N, max=N)`, `float(min=N, max=N)`, `float(precision=N)`. v0.21 semantics per base: `str(min/max)` means string LENGTH (int values), `int/float(min/max)` mean numeric VALUE (inclusive), `float(precision=N)` means EXACTLY N decimal places (renders to JSON Schema `multipleOf: 10**-N`). `bool` accepts no constraint; numeric and string constraints raise distinct parse-time errors (`constraint X not supported on Y`, `precision constraint is only valid on float`). Pydantic v2 Field kwargs: `min_length` / `max_length` / `ge` / `le` / `multiple_of`. Go target inherits constraints via the embedded `clio_runtime/validate` jsonschema/v6 validator — no Go type changes (constraints enforced at runtime, not at the type level). Documented as cookbook recipe #27.

### Fixed

- **`_json_type_to_go` and `_json_type_to_python` (`clio/emitters/_shared_utils.py`) now descend into `additionalProperties`.** Both walkers, used to render Go struct fields and Python type annotations from a CONTRACT's `json_schema` dict, returned the generic `map[string]any` / `dict` for any object-typed subschema. With `Dict<K, V>` introduced this turns into a typed `map[string]<V>` / `dict[str, V]` whenever the subschema carries `additionalProperties: {...}`. Pre-`Dict` this code path was unreachable (no producer emitted typed `additionalProperties`), so the fix is forward-compatible only.

### Tests

- Net `1136 → 1184` (+48).
- `tests/test_parser.py`: +6 for `Dict<K, V>`, +5 for `Optional<T>`, +8 for extended constraints (str(min), int min/max, float min/max, float(precision), three rejection paths).
- `tests/test_ir.py`: +3 for `Dict`, +3 for `Optional`, +5 for extended constraints (str_min, str_min_max combined, int min/max, float min/max, float(precision) → multipleOf 0.01).
- `tests/test_emitters/test_dict_type.py`, `test_optional_type.py`, `test_constraints.py`: 6 + 7 + 6 cross-target smoke tests.

## [0.20.1] — 2026-05-28

Patch release consolidating `clio import` after dogfooding the LLM-assisted path against three hand-written third-party skills (`math-olympiad`, `agent-development`, `hook-development`), plus a catch-up bump of the in-package `__version__` that was missed in the v0.20.0 release-admin PR.

### Fixed

- **`clio import` no longer crashes when the LLM produces a `.clio` that fails lexing, expression parsing, or cross-file resolution.** Prior behaviour: `_llm_validation.validate()` caught only `ParseError` and `IRBuildError`, so a `LexError` (unexpected character), `ExpressionError` (unknown function, malformed comparator), or `CompileError` (resolver failure on `FROM "..." IMPORT`) leaked as an uncaught Python traceback bypassing the retry loop. Now all five parser/IR exception classes are caught and turned into an error string that the retry prompt can show the model. (PR #74)
- **`clio/__init__.py` `__version__` catches up to the project version.** v0.20.0's release-admin PR (#72) bumped `pyproject.toml` 0.19.0 → 0.20.0 but missed `clio/__init__.py`, which stayed at `"0.19.0"`. `ClaudeSkillEmitter` reads this constant when writing `.clio/manifest.json` (the sidecar that powers verbatim `clio import`), so v0.20.0-emitted skills stamped `clio_version: "0.19.0"` in their manifests — cosmetically wrong, no functional impact (hash-based dispatch in `clio import` does not consult the version field). Now both pin to `"0.20.1"` together.

### Improved

- **`clio/prompts/skill_to_clio_system.md` gains a Few-shot example section** (≈125 lines) — one compact valid `.clio` (CONTRACT + exact loader + judgment step with `|` block-scalar `DESCRIPTION:` / `STRATEGIES:` + `FOR EACH PARALLEL`) plus a structured list of pitfalls the LLM repeatedly tripped over in dogfooding: multi-line `SHAPE: { ... }` rejected, `Optional<T>` rejected, nested generics rejected, `CACHE`/`ON_FAIL` are judgment-only, `MATCH` and `IF` require `<contract_field>.<sub_field>` (no bare identifiers), `impl.parse` ∈ {`json`, `none`}, numeric constraints (`int(min=N)`, `float(precision=N)`) rejected, reserved keywords (`sonnet`/`opus`/`haiku`/`python`/`bash`/…) cannot be enum values, step-call args must type-match the callee `TAKES`, `FLOW.GIVES` field names must match step productions. Dogfooding measured: LLM output grew 119 → 151 lines of valid `.clio` over the iteration cycle on `agent-development`, with a successful end-to-end round-trip (skill → `.clio` → `claude-skill` emitter → strict-mode re-import bit-perfect).

### Tests

- 3 new tests in `tests/test_skill_to_clio.py` exercising the retry-loop on `LexError`, `ExpressionError`, `CompileError` (mirror of the existing `ParseError`/`IRBuildError` cases). Net `1133 → 1136` (+3).

### Surfaced (not fixed here — follow-ups)

- **Doc/impl drift in `docs/LANGUAGE_SPEC.md`**: `Optional<T>` (line 155), `int(min=N, max=N)` (line 158, 1321), and `float(precision=N)` are documented as supported but the parser rejects them (`expected RBRACE, got LANGLE '<'` and `constrained types are only supported on str in v0.1`). Either the parser should be extended to honour the spec, or the spec tightened to match. Tracked separately.

## [0.20.0] — 2026-05-18

Minor release introducing the **sixth compilation target `target: go`** — emits a runnable Go module (`flow.Run(ctx, kwargs)` package + `cmd/<flow>/main.go` CLI) using `anthropic-sdk-go v1.43.0` for judgment steps and `errgroup` for parallel FOR EACH. Cache layout is byte-identical to `target: python` so `.cache/` directories swap between targets. Net test count `1067 → 1133` (+66). PR #71 (squash-merged on `main` at `0323ee8`), 31 commits + 21 TDD tasks executed via subagent-driven development. Gemini cycle closed with 1 HIGH applied (cache_block_post indentation in retry loop). Two Critical bugs caught by code review during the sprint: validate.go template read `m["fn"]` instead of `"func"` (every `len()`-based ASSERT silently false); pinned `anthropic-sdk-go v0.5.0` which doesn't exist (Go module proxy returns `unknown revision`) — corrected to `v1.43.0` + v1.x plain-field API after Context7 verification. CI runner caught a third post-PR bug: step files referenced contract types by their bare class name (`CustomerRisk`) instead of the qualified `contracts.CustomerRisk` — fixed before merge.

### Added

- **`target: go` — sixth compilation target.** v0.20.0 scope covers CONTRACT, exact (LANG: go) and judgment (anthropic-sdk-go v1.43.0), IF/MATCH/WHILE, FOR EACH (sequential + parallel via `golang.org/x/sync/errgroup`), RESCUE, ON_FAIL chain (retry with exponential backoff / fallback / abort), CACHE (layout interchangeable with python target), RESOURCES. Five emitter modules under `clio/emitters/` (`go.py`, `_go_helpers.py`, `_go_step_renderers.py`, `_go_runtime_templates.py`, `_go_flow_renderer.py`). Embedded Go runtime templates: `clio_runtime/validate` (jsonschema/v6 + x-clio-assert walker) and `clio_runtime/cache` (SHA256 content-addressed).
- 11 new compile-time refused-combo errors (`E_GO_001` … `E_GO_012`, with E_GO_011 omitted since RESUME is a first-class IR node) documented in `docs/manual/06-troubleshooting.md`. Deferred-to-v0.20.x features (OpenAI SDK, FLOW composition, impl.mode rest/sql/mcp_tool/shell, TEST blocks) raise at compile time with a remediation pointer to `--target python`.

### Docs

- `docs/COMPILATION_TARGETS.md`: `target: go` moves from "Future" to "Implemented"; canonical entry added with layout, use, refused combos, inherited features, logging, resume, cache, and model-name-mapping sections.
- `docs/LANGUAGE_SPEC.md`: Go added to the `LANG per step` target table.
- `docs/manual/04-targets.md`: Go column added to the cross-target feature matrix; `go` section added to the "When to use which" guide.
- `docs/manual/06-troubleshooting.md`: entries for E_GO_001..E_GO_010 and E_GO_012, plus "missing Go toolchain" and module-cache notes.
- `docs/manual/03-cookbook.md`: new recipe "Compile a flow to a Go binary" walks through `clio compile → go mod tidy → go build → run`.
- `README.md`: `go` added to the compilation targets table; "5 emitters" updated to "6 emitters" in the Current status section.

### Tests

- 66 new tests across `tests/test_emitters/test_go.py`, `tests/test_emitters/test_go_compile.py`, and `tests/test_emitters/test_shared_utils.py`. Net `1067 → 1133` (+66). The `test_go_compile.py` smoke runs `go build ./...` against the minimal contract fixture; skipped locally when Go is not on PATH but fires green on CI (caught the bare-class-name bug pre-merge).
- 5 new fixtures: `tests/fixtures/{go_minimal,go_judgment,go_control_flow,go_parallel,go_rescue}.clio`.
- 4 new golden snapshots: `tests/fixtures/expected_go/{go_minimal,go_judgment,go_parallel,mvp_go}/`.
- New example: `examples/mvp_go.clio` (customer-retention flow exercising CONTRACT + exact + judgment + CACHE + ON_FAIL chain end-to-end).

## [0.19.0] — 2026-05-17

Minor release introducing the **`clio import` sub-command** — a round-trip recovery of `.clio` sources from emitted skills (verbatim via the new `.clio/` sidecar when hashes match) and an LLM-assisted import path for arbitrary hand-written Claude Code skills (Anthropic SDK, one-shot validation-retry loop). Net test count `997 → 1067` (+70); 5 new opt-in `e2e_llm` tests skipped by default. PR #66 (squash-merged on `main` at `0834077`), 22 commits + 17 TDD tasks executed via subagent-driven development. Gemini cycle closed with 3 MEDIUM applied + 2 pushback (datetime.UTC Py3.11+/project Py3.12; multi-file IMPORT sidecar deferred to v0.20, see #67).

### Added

- **`clio import <skill-dir>` — recover a `.clio` source from a Claude Code skill directory.** Two dispatched paths: (Path A) when the skill carries a CLIO-emitted `.clio/` sidecar (new in v0.19) and recorded SHA-256 hashes match the current file state, returns the verbatim `source.clio` (no LLM call); (Path B, default fallback) calls the Anthropic SDK with the skill's text content and a one-shot validation-retry loop. Modes: `--mode auto` (default, dispatches based on sidecar presence + hash match), `--mode strict` (requires sidecar + matching hashes, else exit 2), `--mode infer` (always LLM, ignores sidecar). New module `clio/skill_to_clio.py` mirrors the existing `nl_to_clio` architecture; new helper `clio/emitters/_sidecar.py` implements hashing (LF-normalized for text, raw for binary) and drift detection. The system prompt instructs the LLM to preserve the source skill's user-facing language in `DESCRIPTION` / `STRATEGIES` / prompt bodies, and to flag inferred elements with `# CLIO-import: ...` annotations.
- **`target: claude-skill` — `.clio/` sidecar written alongside emitted skills.** Every `clio compile --target claude-skill` now writes `<skill>/.clio/source.clio` (verbatim copy of the source `.clio`) and `<skill>/.clio/manifest.json` (CLIO version, emission timestamp, source hash, per-file hashes). Enables the trivial round-trip path of `clio import`. Sidecar emission is silent on failure (warns to stderr, never blocks main emission). The sidecar is excluded from `_gather_skill_files` so `clio import --mode infer` cannot accidentally cheat.

### Changed

- **`BaseEmitter.emit(...)` — new keyword-only parameter `source_path: Path | None = None`.** Plumbed by `_cmd_compile` for all five targets; consumed only by `ClaudeSkillEmitter` (for the sidecar). The four other emitters accept and ignore it — no behavior change.
- **`clio/nl_to_clio.py` — prompts extracted to `clio/prompts/*.md`.** The inline `_ROLE_INTRO` / `_OUTPUT_RULES` / retry-message constants are now `clio/prompts/nl_to_clio_system.md` and `clio/prompts/nl_to_clio_retry.md`, loaded via the new `clio/prompts/load_prompt(name)` helper. Pure refactor — `generate()` behavior is unchanged.

### Docs

- `docs/LANGUAGE_SPEC.md`: new section "The `.clio/` sidecar convention" documenting the emit-side artifact and import-side drift detection contract.
- `docs/manual/05-cli-reference.md`: `clio import` synopsis, modes table, exit codes, examples.
- `docs/manual/03-cookbook.md`: new recipe "Recover the `.clio` source from a skill".
- `docs/manual/06-troubleshooting.md`: entries for "drift detected" warning, "skill payload too large" abort, and LLM retry-budget exhaustion.

## [0.18.3] — 2026-05-17

Patch release rolling up **PR #56**, which bundled two coupled changes in a single commit: `target: langgraph` delegates flow-level observability to LangSmith via an inline no-op `clio_runtime/logging.py` stub (removing the half-active verbatim copy of `clio/runtime/logging.py` that the emitter never instrumented at the flow level), and `docs/POSITIONING.md` was synced with shipment status (date-free horizon labels + per-row Status column; the former "LangGraph — conditional, not now" section is renamed "LangGraph — shipped" with its three pre-ship conditions now marked ✅). No language, IR-shape, parser, or other-target change. Net test count `996 → 997` (+1).

### Changed

- **`target: langgraph` — observability delegated to LangSmith via a no-op `clio_runtime/logging.py` stub.** Previously the langgraph emitter copied `clio/runtime/logging.py` verbatim into the emitted project, but the langgraph emitter never instruments `flow_start/end` itself — it only inherits `step_start/end` from the python step bodies it reuses, and `POSITIONING.md` (section "LangGraph — shipped (bridge target, delegated observability)") is explicit that flow-level observability on this target is owned by LangSmith. The verbatim copy was therefore half-active (step-level emit, no flow-level emit, ambiguous semantics vs. LangSmith). The emitter now writes a small inline stub exposing `emit(event, **fields) -> None` and `set_flow(name) -> None` as no-ops; the reused python step bodies (`from ..clio_runtime import logging as _log; _log.emit(...)`) still compile and run but emit nothing. To get JSON-line events, compile to `--target python` or `--target mcp-server`, which continue to ship the full runtime and honour `CLIO_LOG=1` / `CLIO_LOG_FILE=path.jsonl` unchanged. New regression test `test_clio_runtime_logging_is_no_op_stub` asserts the stub marker and the no-op return value.

### Docs

- **`docs/POSITIONING.md` — Action plan synced with shipment status.** The version-tagged horizons (`v0.4 – v0.5`, `v0.6 – v0.8`) were obsolete (project is at v0.18.2) and silently misled readers. Replaced with date-free labels (`1–2 milestones out`, `3–5 milestones out`, `v1.0 and beyond`) plus an explicit per-row status column (✅ shipped / 🟡 partial / ⬜ open). Marked: W1 short+mid ✅, W2 short ✅ (with langgraph delegation note), W3 short+mid ✅, W4 short ✅ + mid 🟡, W5 short ✅ (implemented as `--from-step N` on emitted python projects, not as a `clio resume` compiler subcommand). The "LangGraph — conditional, not now" section is renamed to "LangGraph — shipped (bridge target, delegated observability)" and its three pre-ship conditions are now marked ✅ rather than "to satisfy". No semantic shift in the principles themselves.

## [0.18.2] — 2026-05-16

Patch release rolling up **PR #54** (community contribution from Sandjab) — narration polish for `target: claude-skill` so the emitted SKILL.md no longer hides sub-step pointers or contradicts the compile-time `PARALLEL` warning. No language, IR-shape, or other-target change. Net test count `993 → 996` (+3). Doc-only PR #53 (LANGUAGE_SPEC TOC reorder + cookbook mcp-server façade recipe) also landed in this window but is not listed below (docs-only changes do not get CHANGELOG entries on this project).

### Changed

- **`target: claude-skill` — IF / MATCH narration names sub-steps.** `render_if_section` and `render_match_section` previously rendered branches and cases as a count only (`**True branch**: 2 sub-step(s) (see ordinal sections above/below)`, `Case 'spam': 1 sub-step(s)`), forcing the host LLM to grep back to the flat `## Step NN — <name>` cards without a direct pointer. Both helpers now list each sub-step by name (`**True branch**: \`human_review\``, `Case \`spam\`: \`archive\``), via a new shared `_summarise_branch_items` helper. Direct `CallIR` / `FlowCallIR` children are named verbatim; nested control-flow children (IF / MATCH / FOR EACH / WHILE inside another branch) are flagged as `nested IF` / `nested MATCH` etc. so the host knows to look for an inner section. Tests added: `test_if_section_names_then_and_else_substeps`, `test_match_section_names_substeps_per_case`.

### Fixed

- **`target: claude-skill` — PARALLEL FOR EACH narration ↔ warning coherence.** When the source declares `FOR EACH ... PARALLEL AS <collector>`, the compile-time warning correctly states *"the emitted skill serializes iterations (the LLM host does not execute concurrently)"*, but the narration in SKILL.md previously contradicted that with `(PARALLEL mode)`, misleading the host into expecting concurrent execution. The narration now mirrors the warning: *"the source declares PARALLEL, but the emitted skill serialises iterations — the LLM host does not execute concurrently"*. Test added: `test_for_each_parallel_narration_states_serialisation`.

## [0.18.1] — 2026-05-16

Patch release rolling up three cross-file IMPORT / EXPOSE correctness fixes (closes **#47**, **#48**, **#49**) surfaced by Gemini review of PR #46 (the v0.18.0 release-admin). Consolidated in PR #50. No language or IR-shape change — the compiler now actually enforces what `LANGUAGE_SPEC.md` already promised about re-exports, import clashes, and TEST alias resolution. Net test count `989 → 993` (+4).

### Fixed

- **Re-exported FLOWs now appear in `exposed_flow_names`** (closes #47) — an entry file using `EXPOSE <imported_name>` to re-publish an imported FLOW was previously silently dropped from the merged program's public surface. Root cause: `_flatten_to_program` forced `exposed=False` on every non-entry-file FlowDecl (correct in isolation, since imported FLOWs are not "declared" in the entry), and the entry's `ReexportDecl` did not re-flip the flag. Fix: collect the resolved re-export targets (mapping local name through `imported_scope`) during Pass 2, then stamp `exposed=True` on matching `FlowDecl`/`ContractDecl` in a final post-pass. This corrects the downstream symptom on `target: mcp-server`, where re-exported flows are once again registered as tools. Both bare and `AS`-aliased re-exports are covered.
- **E_RES_006 import clash check now considers `StepDecl`** (closes #48) — `validate_imports` only built `local_decl_names` from `FlowDecl` and `ContractDecl`, so a local `STEP foo` colliding with `FROM lib IMPORT foo` was not raised. The shadow was silent and load-bearing: `_rename_decl.resolve_name` checks `imported_scope` before `local_renames`, so references to `foo` in subsequent declarations resolved to the imported flow instead of the local STEP. Fix: add `StepDecl` to both the name-collection and the diagnostic-message lookup so the existing E_RES_006 message fires uniformly across all three declaration kinds.
- **`TEST ... FLOW: <alias>` resolves through `imported_scope`** (closes #49) — a TEST block referencing an imported FLOW by its `AS` alias raised `IRBuildError: unknown flow '<alias>'` at `_build_tests` because `_rename_test_decl` only consulted `local_renames`. Fix: thread `imported_scope` into `_rename_test_decl` and apply the same precedence as `_rename_decl.resolve_name` (imported_scope first, then local_renames), so the alias is rewritten to its target name before test-suite construction.

## [0.18.0] — 2026-05-16

### Added

- Cross-file imports: new `FROM "<path>" IMPORT <name> [AS <alias>], ...`
  declaration enables sharing of `FLOW`s and `CONTRACT`s across `.clio`
  files. Paths are relative to the importing file, posix-style, with
  `.clio` extension.
- Explicit visibility markers: `EXPOSE` and `INTERNAL` may now prefix
  `FLOW` and `CONTRACT` declarations. The v0.17 sibling-call heuristic
  for `target: mcp-server` is replaced by explicit `EXPOSE` markers.
- Re-export support: a top-level `EXPOSE <name>` re-exports a
  previously-imported symbol.
- `clio doctor --migrate-v018 [--write]`: mechanical migration tool
  that applies the v0.17 heuristic and proposes/applies `EXPOSE`
  insertions.
- New multi-file example project under `examples/multi_file/`.

### Changed

- `target: mcp-server` now requires at least one `EXPOSE FLOW` in the
  entry file (E_MCP_001). Files relying on the v0.17 implicit exposure
  must be migrated.
- `target: claude-cli` rejects sources containing `FROM ... IMPORT ...`
  (E_CLI_001). Use `python`, `mcp-server`, `claude-skill`, or
  `langgraph` for multi-file projects, or inline the imported FLOWs.

### Migration

See `docs/manual/06-migration-v018.md` for the full migration guide.

## v0.17.3 — 2026-05-15

Patch release rolling up the post-v0.17.2 polish bundle: one feature (FLOW.DESCRIPTION) and three test/emitter correctness fixes, landed on `main` over three feature PRs (#39, #41, #42, plus the partial-Edit recovery in #41 commit `01deead`). Closes follow-up issues **#37** (cross-emitter FOR EACH + MATCH sanitization) and **#40** (uppercase French diacritics). No language or IR change beyond the new optional `FLOW.DESCRIPTION` field. Net test count `903 → 924` (+21).

### Added

- **Optional `FLOW.DESCRIPTION` field** — mirror of `STEP.DESCRIPTION` (v0.15). A FLOW may now declare a free-text `DESCRIPTION:` (quoted string or `|` block scalar) alongside `TAKES:` / `GIVES:`. The `claude-skill` target injects it verbatim into the `SKILL.md` frontmatter `description:`, which is the signal the host LLM uses to auto-trigger the skill on intent match. When omitted, the emitter still falls back to `Execute flow <name>` with the existing weak-auto-trigger warning. Captured on `FlowDecl.description` (AST) and `FlowIR.description` (IR); other emitters currently ignore the field. Parser exposes it as an optional FLOW header block; duplicate `DESCRIPTION:` is a parse error. New tests cover the parser (quoted string + block scalar + ordering with TAKES/GIVES + duplicate rejection + backcompat default-None) and the claude-skill frontmatter wire-through. The previously-skipped `test_frontmatter_uses_flow_description_when_present` is now a regular passing test.

### Fixed

- **`test_cache_block_uses_fr_label_when_flow_is_french` no longer silently skipped** — the test wrapped `build_ir(parse(...))` in a bare `try / except Exception: pytest.skip(...)` with a misleading "not parseable with current grammar" message. The real cause was a fixture bug (`MODE: exact` + `CACHE: ttl(24h)` — CACHE is judgment-only). The source is now `MODE: judgment`, the try/except is removed (parse errors fail loudly), and the assertion is tightened to require `"Mise en cache"` only (the previous `"Mise en cache" in body or "Cache" in body` would have passed even if FR detection silently regressed). The test now exercises FR detection cleanly via the new `FLOW.DESCRIPTION` field.
- **Cross-emitter sanitization sweep for `FOR EACH` inner-collection + `MATCH base.sub_field`** (closes issue #37) — completes the bug class first surfaced by Gemini on PR #36 (mcp-server fix in commit `47e2d7b`). `python.py` was missing `_to_field_name` on `ForEachIR.collection` when in `scope_local` (nested FOR EACH over outer keyword-named loop var) and on both `MatchBlockIR.state_field` (when local) + `sub_field` (always — Pydantic attr access on a contract field renamed via `Field(alias='class')`). `_langgraph_helpers.py` was missing the same `sub_field` sanitization on the MATCH router. `claude-skill` is unaffected (different per-script dispatch). Three new parametrized regression tests in `tests/test_emitters/test_keyword_identifiers.py` (FOR EACH × 3 emitters and MATCH × 3 emitters) `ast.parse` the emitted Python.
- **`detect_skill_language` recognises uppercase French diacritics + broader marker set** (closes issue #40, addresses Gemini PR #42 medium feedback) — `fr_markers = set("éèàçôîêûïü")` was lowercase-only. A description opening with a capital diacritic (`Évaluer le risque...` — natural sentence-start French) was silently classified as EN. Fixed by case-folding the joined samples via `text.lower()` before scanning. Marker set expanded to include `â` (château / âme), `ù` (où — French-only in modern usage), and `ë` (Noël / Citroën). Ligatures `œ` / `æ` deliberately excluded — they appear in archaic / scientific English (`encyclopædia`, `fœtus`, quoted FR loans cited in EN text) and would create false positives; the heuristic is a hint, not a classifier. New parametrized unit test covers seven samples (capital-first / new markers / lowercase baseline).

## v0.17.2 — 2026-05-15

Patch release rolling up the post-v0.17.1 polish bundle that landed on `main` over three feature PRs: PR #34 (closes #33 — STEP/FLOW name sanitization), PR #35 (issue #29 items 2-4 — mcp project dir + tool ordering + langgraph state type), and PR #36 (issue #29 item 1 — single/multi async walker dedup + Gemini-surfaced FOR EACH/MATCH sanitization). No language or IR change — purely emitter correctness + cleanup. Issue #37 is filed for the same FOR EACH/MATCH sanitization in `python.py` and `_langgraph_helpers.py`, where the bug class also lives.

### Changed

- **mcp-server: project dir name derives from the first declared exposed FLOW** (issue #29, item 2) — when a multi-FLOW source is compiled without `--flow`, the project directory was previously named with the generic `clio_mcp` fallback. It now derives from the **first declared exposed FLOW** (`graph.flows` preserves declaration order; `exposed_flow_names` is a frozenset filtered against it). `_safe_package_name` also keyword-sanitizes its `default=` argument, so a derived name like `class` collapses to `class_`. Single-FLOW sources are unaffected.
- **mcp-server: `@mcp.tool()` handlers emitted in declaration order** (issue #29, item 3) — `server.py`'s lowlevel `Tool()` registry and `call_tool` dispatch chain previously used `sorted(graph.exposed_flow_names)` (alphabetical). They now walk `graph.flows` filtered against `exposed_flow_names`, giving declaration order that matches the source-file layout. No flag — alphabetical was an implementation detail, not a stability guarantee. Single-FLOW sources are unaffected.
- **mcp-server: dedup single-/multi-FLOW chain walker** (issue #29, item 1) — `_emit_flow_module_async` (single-FLOW, byte-identical from v0.16) and `_emit_flow_module_async_multi` (v0.17) each defined their own nested `_emit_call` / `_emit_item` (and the multi path's `_emit_flow_call`) closures with byte-identical bodies. The walker is now factored into three module-level helpers (`_emit_call_mcp_chain`, `_emit_flow_call_mcp_chain`, `_emit_item_mcp_chain`) parameterised by a small `_McpWalkerCtx` dataclass. The `supports_flow_call` flag on the ctx gates `FlowCallIR` dispatch (defence in depth — the IR builder already guarantees no `FlowCallIR` appears when `len(graph.flows) <= 1`). All existing snapshot fixtures remain byte-identical.
- **langgraph: node wrappers stop lying about state type** (issue #29, item 4) — step and sub-flow node wrappers were emitted at module level with `state: State` (the main FLOW's TypedDict) but reused inside every `build_<sub>_graph()` sub-graph builder, where the actual runtime state type is `_State_<sub>`. Wrappers now declare `state: dict[str, Any]` — runtime is unchanged (TypedDicts are dicts), and mypy / pyright no longer see a misleading type. `from typing import Any` added to the emitted imports block. Per-flow wrappers (more precise, with (step, flow) duplication) deferred as future work.

### Fixed

- **Sanitize `STEP` and `FLOW` names that match Python keywords** (issue #33) — follow-up to #28. The TAKES/GIVES + `FOR EACH` loop-variable fix in v0.17.1 sanitized field and loop identifiers but left `STEP` and `FLOW` names themselves un-sanitized. `STEP class` now compiles to `def class_(x):` (with `from .steps import class_ as class__mod` and `class__mod.class_(x=x)` at the call site) across `python`, `mcp-server`, `langgraph`, and `claude-skill` instead of producing a `SyntaxError`. FLOW-name-derived identifiers were already prefix-protected (`run_<name>`, `_State_<name>`, `build_<name>_graph`, `sub_<name>.py`); a regression test is added for parity. `claude-cli` is out of scope (shell target). Two new parametrized tests in `tests/test_emitters/test_keyword_identifiers.py` exercise `STEP class` (4 emitters) and `FLOW return` (4 emitters).
- **mcp-server: sanitize `FOR EACH` inner collection and `MATCH base.sub_field` positions** (Gemini PR #36 review) — two latent positions in `_emit_item_mcp_chain` were emitting raw user-declared names: a nested `FOR EACH` whose collection references an outer keyword-named loop variable (`for y in class:`) and a `MATCH` scrutinee on a Pydantic contract field whose name is a keyword (`match state['result'].class:`). Both now route through `_to_field_name`. The same bug class lives in `python.py` and `_langgraph_helpers.py` (verified by direct emission) and is tracked in issue #37.

### Known limitations

- Issue #37 still open at release time: the FOR EACH inner-collection sanitization in `python.py`, and the MATCH `sub_field` sanitization in `python.py` + `_langgraph_helpers.py`, were not part of this release. `claude-skill` is unaffected (different per-script dispatch). Will be addressed in the next patch.

## v0.17.1 — 2026-05-15

Patch release rolling up the emitter identifier-sanitization bug fix that landed on `main` via PR #31 (closes #28). No language or IR change — purely an emit-side correctness fix.

### Fixed

- **Sanitize Python identifiers in all emitters** (issue #28) — when a `STEP`, `FLOW`, or `FOR EACH` declares an identifier whose name collides with a Python keyword (`from`, `class`, `return`, …), every Python-emitting target (`python`, `mcp-server`, `langgraph`, `claude-skill`) now passes the name through `_to_field_name` wherever it lands in a Python identifier position (kwarg LHS, local variable, function-signature parameter, `FOR EACH` loop variable definition + usage). Dict-key positions (`state["from"]`) keep the original name. Previously the emitter produced a syntactically invalid Python file (`SyntaxError` on `from=state['from']`, `def relay(from, class):`, `async def _bound_text(return):`, `from_=return`). New cross-emitter regression test `tests/test_emitters/test_keyword_identifiers.py` `ast.parse`s every emitted `.py` for the four targets, exercising both `TAKES` / `GIVES` field-name positions (all four targets) and `FOR EACH PARALLEL` loop-variable positions (python, mcp-server, claude-skill — langgraph rejects `FOR EACH` at compile time).

## v0.17.0 — 2026-05-15

FLOW composition (issue #24): a signed `FLOW` (one with explicit `TAKES:` / `GIVES:`) can now be called wherever a STEP is legal — chains, `FOR EACH PARALLEL` bodies, `IF` / `MATCH` / `WHILE`, and `RESCUE`. Shipped as PR #27; closes #24.

### Language

- **FLOW composition** (`docs/LANGUAGE_SPEC.md` §FLOW composition) — a `FLOW` with explicit `TAKES:` / `GIVES:` can now be called as a step in another `FLOW`. The call resolves as a `FlowCallIR` (distinct from `CallIR`). Resolution order: step name first, signed flow name second; a shared name is rejected as a compile-time collision. Recursive sub-flows and inter-flow cycles are rejected at IR build time. `PARALLEL FOR EACH` bodies: the v0.16 "exactly one step call" restriction is lifted — a body may now be either a step call or a single sub-flow call.

### Emitters

- `python`: each signed sub-FLOW becomes a top-level `run_<name>(**takes) -> dict` function in `flow.py`; the parent chain invokes it and publishes its `GIVES` fields flat into `state`. Unsigned FLOWs keep v0.16 behaviour.
- `mcp-server`: multi-FLOW sources now emit one `@mcp.tool()` per *exposed* FLOW (every signed FLOW not called by a sibling). Sub-flow calls compile to plain Python function calls within the tool handler.
- `claude-skill`: each signed sub-FLOW becomes a standalone `scripts/sub_<name>.py` orchestrator the main script invokes; `GIVES` fields are merged flat into `state.json`.
- `langgraph`: each signed sub-FLOW becomes its own `build_<name>_graph()` builder; sub-flow calls in a parent flow register the compiled sub-graph as a node and merge its outputs back flat into the parent's `State` TypedDict.
- `claude-cli`: rejects any source containing sub-flow calls with a clear `ValueError` (sub-shell-based isolation is deferred).

### IR

- **`FlowCallIR`** — new IR node distinct from `CallIR`, returned by `_build_call` when the call resolves to a signed FLOW.
- **`FlowGraph.flows`** + **`FlowGraph.exposed_flow_names`** — every `FlowIR` is now built (not just the selected main); emitters that need the full multi-flow surface consume them.
- `_build_call` now accepts a flow-signature map; all downstream builder helpers thread it through.

### Example

- New `examples/flow_composition.clio` — exercises the reuse + `PARALLEL FOR EACH` + sub-flow patterns.

### Documentation

- New `§FLOW composition (v0.17)` section in `docs/LANGUAGE_SPEC.md`.
- New cookbook recipe in `docs/manual/03-cookbook.md`.

### Known limitations

- A `PARALLEL FOR EACH` body that is a sub-flow with multiple `GIVES` fields produces a list-of-dicts collector; the parent's declared `List<T>` annotation will not match. Single-`GIVES` sub-flows publish `List<gives.type>` cleanly.
- No cross-file `IMPORT` yet — all sub-flow callees must live in the same `.clio` source.
- No `EXPOSE` / `INTERNAL` marker — the default rule (expose uncalled signed FLOWs) is fixed for now.
- `target: claude-cli` does not support sub-flow composition; use `target: python` or `target: mcp-server` instead.

### Tests

- 880 passed, 15 skipped, 1 xfailed (was 859 at v0.16.0). +21 tests.

### Closes

- #24 (FLOW composition — sub-flow callable as a step).

---

## v0.16.0 — 2026-05-15

Adds optional `TAKES:` / `GIVES:` blocks to `FLOW` declarations, mirroring `STEP`. Shipped as PR #25; closes #21 and #23.

### Language

- **`FLOW.TAKES` and `FLOW.GIVES`** (`docs/LANGUAGE_SPEC.md` §FLOW signature) — `FLOW` declarations now accept optional `TAKES:` and `GIVES:` blocks mirroring `STEP`. When `FLOW.TAKES` is declared, the named inputs are seeded into the chain's initial scope, so a chain that starts with `FOR EACH` / `IF` / `WHILE` over an external identifier compiles cleanly (closes #21, #23). When `FLOW.GIVES` is declared, the IR builder verifies subset coverage against the last chain item's effective state at compile time. When both blocks are absent, v0.15.1 behaviour is preserved (StepCall auto-promote for inputs, last-step inference for outputs).

### Emitters

- `python`: `run()` gains a typed signature derived from `FLOW.TAKES` when declared, and returns a dict keyed by `FLOW.GIVES` field names. Backward-compatible: flows without a declared signature keep the v0.15 `**initial` / full-state-return shape.
- `mcp-server` and `claude-skill`: `inputSchema` / `outputSchema` (resp. SKILL.md Inputs / Outputs sections) derive from `FLOW.TAKES` / `FLOW.GIVES` when declared, replacing the previous first-step / last-step inference. `claude-skill` emits Inputs / Outputs markdown sections only when the FLOW signature is declared (v0.15 output is byte-identical for unsigned flows).
- `langgraph`: the emitted `State` TypedDict reflects declared FLOW.TAKES alongside the per-step GIVES. `run()` returns only the declared FLOW.GIVES subset when present.
- `claude-cli`: the emitted README surfaces declared FLOW inputs (initial `state.json` keys) when the FLOW signature is declared.

### TEST block

- `WITH:` kwarg names and Python literal types are type-checked at parse time against `FLOW.TAKES` when declared. `EXPECTS:` / `EXPECTS_NOT:` field paths are validated against `FLOW.GIVES`. When the target FLOW does not declare a signature, the v0.15 runtime-only behaviour is preserved.

### Example

- New `examples/flow_signature.clio` — minimal demonstration of the top-level `FOR EACH PARALLEL` pattern, with `FLOW.TAKES` / `FLOW.GIVES` declared, compiling to `python`, `mcp-server`, and `claude-skill`.

### Closes

- #21 (FOR EACH at the head of a chain over an external input).
- #23 (parent issue for this feature).

---

## v0.15.1 — 2026-05-15

Bug-fix bundle for issues #17 / #18 / #19, shipped as PR #20.

### Fixed

- **emitter(python): per-step `invoke.model` aliases now resolve to versioned IDs** (#17). Previously `invoke: {protocol: anthropic, model: sonnet}` emitted `_MODELS = ('sonnet',)` and the alias was rejected by the Anthropic API with `BadRequestError`. The `ApiInvokeIR` path now routes through the same `_model_id()` resolver as the `RESOURCES.models` path, so `sonnet` → `claude-sonnet-4-6`, `haiku` → `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`, `opus` → `claude-opus-4-7`. Unknown names (e.g. raw OpenAI/Bedrock IDs) pass through unchanged.
- **emitter(python): Pydantic `ContractRef` inputs to judgment steps are now `.model_dump()`'d before `json.dumps`** (#18). Previously a judgment step that took a `ContractRef` input crashed with `TypeError: Object of type X is not JSON serializable` on the prompt-substitution path. `List<ContractRef>` is also handled element-wise. The new helper `_prompt_subst_expr` lives in `clio/emitters/_shared_utils.py`.
- **parser/IR: first-step identifier kwargs are auto-promoted to FLOW inputs** (#19). Previously `load_article(file=file)` on the very first step of a FLOW raised `state reference 'file' not produced by any previous step` -- so `TEST WITH:` kwargs were silently dead and CLI `--kwargs '{"file": ...}'` had no effect when the first step took a literal. Now the first step's identifier kwargs that don't match an upstream produced field are recognised as external inputs (typed via the matching `TAKES` entry) and seeded into `state[]` at runtime via `run(**initial)`. Subsequent steps still strictly validate against produced fields. **Known limitation** (tracked as #21): when the first chain item is a control-flow block (`FOR EACH` / `IF` / `WHILE`) over an external identifier, the promotion does not trigger and the v0.15 error is still raised.

### Examples

- Add `examples/projects/01-iterative-refiner/` -- full project demonstrating the writer/critic refine loop with `WHILE ... MAX 3` and per-step `invoke.model` overrides. Includes committed `--target python` output and a CI drift guard at `tests/test_examples_projects/`.
- `examples/projects/01-iterative-refiner/flow.clio`: switch the first step from a literal (`load_article(file="article.txt")`) to an identifier kwarg (`load_article(file=file)`) now that #19 makes this compilable. The committed `expected_output/` and the `TEST WITH: file: "data/article.txt"` clause are now actually exercised by the CLI's `--kwargs` flag.

### Tests

- 834 passed, 15 skipped, 1 xfailed (was 788 at v0.15.0). +46 tests: 11 for the bug fixes themselves, the rest for the new example project and its CI drift guard.

## v0.15.0 — 2026-05-14

OpenProse-inspired sprint: borrows the most defensible ideas from
`openprose/prose` (diagnostic command, free-text intent, status command,
declarative tests, multi-flow files) without sacrificing CLIO's
deterministic-compiler philosophy. See
[docs/COMPARISON_OPENPROSE.md](docs/COMPARISON_OPENPROSE.md) for the full
side-by-side comparison and why each idea was either adopted, deferred, or
rejected.

### Added

- **`clio doctor [SOURCE]`** — environment diagnostic command. Checks Python
  version, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, anthropic SDK importability, and (when a
  `.clio` source is given) MCP server commands on PATH plus declared database
  URL parsability. Exits 1 on any FAIL, 0 otherwise.
- **`clio status [--state-file PATH] [--log-file PATH] [--limit N]`** — read a
  python-target run's `state.json` and tail the last N events from a
  `CLIO_LOG_FILE` JSONL log. Useful for "what was the last run, where did it
  stop, what events did it emit" without writing custom tooling.
- **`DESCRIPTION:` and `STRATEGIES:` per STEP** — optional free-text fields
  (single-line `"..."` or `|` block scalar) carrying author intent and edge-case
  heuristics. The python emitter appends them as a "Step intent: …" and
  "Heuristics: …" suffix to the judgment step's `_SYSTEM_PROMPT`, so the model
  has the context without changing the strict JSON-only output contract.
  Byte-identical to v0.14 output when neither field is set.
- **Multiple `FLOW` declarations per source file** — `clio compile` and
  `clio graph` accept `--flow <name>` to pick one. Single-FLOW files behave
  exactly as before. Duplicate FLOW names are rejected at IR build time with a
  source-line message.
- **`TEST` top-level block** — declarative tests with `FLOW: <name>`, optional
  `WITH:` kwargs, and `EXPECTS:` / `EXPECTS_NOT:` predicate blocks. Predicates:
  `not_empty`, `empty`, `== <literal>`, `!= <literal>`, `> N`, `>= N`, `< N`,
  `<= N`, `contains <literal>`. Emitted as pytest files under `<output>/tests/`
  by the **python** target. Other targets ignore TESTs (no crash).
- `docs/COMPARISON_OPENPROSE.md` — comparative analysis with openprose: grid,
  similarities, each side, narrative positioning, and the cross-pollination
  table that drove this sprint.

### Internal

- `clio/diagnostics.py` — new module with status and doctor logic.

---

## v0.14.0 — 2026-05-14

### Added

- `target: claude-skill` — new compilation target that emits a Claude Code skill directory
  (`SKILL.md` + `scripts/` + `schemas/` + `prompts/` + `process_flow.dot`). The emitted
  skill is LLM-host-orchestrated (no external runtime, no API key, no CLIO binary
  required after install). Parity with v0.13 features: RESCUE handlers, `step.error.*`,
  RESUME terminator, CACHE, RETRY (via OnFail strategy notes), RESOURCES annex.
- `clio/emitters/_shared_utils.py` — type-utility helpers extracted from `_python_helpers.py`
  to be shared by `python`, `mcp-server`, and `claude-skill` emitters.
- Bundled runtime helpers in every emitted skill: `scripts/_validate.py` (JSON Schema
  validation with stdlib fallback) and `scripts/_cache_key.py` (deterministic SHA256
  cache-key generator).
- `examples/skill_minimal.clio` — minimal example that compiles cleanly to `--target claude-skill`.

---

## v0.13.0 — 2026-05-14

### Language

- **RESCUE handler can inspect the captured error** (`docs/LANGUAGE_SPEC.md` §RESCUE):
  `<rescued_step>.error.message` (str) and `<rescued_step>.error.type` (str = Python
  exception classname) are now valid as kwarg values in step calls inside a RESCUE
  body. The reference is validated at compile time: the step must be the one
  protected by the enclosing handler, and the field must be `message` or `type`.

- **RESUME terminator** (same section): `RESUME(<fallback_step>.<field>)` is a
  second legal terminator of a RESCUE body, next to `abort("...")`. The fallback
  step must be called earlier in the same chain, the field must exist in its
  GIVES, and the field's type must structurally equal the rescued step's GIVES
  type. After RESUME, the flow continues normally with `state[<rescued_field>]`
  set to the injected value.

### Parser

- `_parse_call_arg` accepts a 3-segment dotted kwarg value `<step>.error.<field>`
  in addition to STRING, NUMBER, and IDENT shorthand. Other 3-segment patterns
  (middle ≠ `error`) raise a ParseError with a clear pointer to the supported shape.

- `RESUME` is a new closed keyword. `parse_rescue_block` recognises
  `RESUME(<step>.<field>)` as a terminator alongside `abort("...")`.

### IR

- New IR nodes `ErrorAccessIR(rescued_step, field, line)` and
  `ResumeIR(fallback_step, field_name, line)`. `RescueBlockIR.body`'s union widens
  to accept `ResumeIR` as a legal terminator.

- IR build validates 7 new rules at compile time, each with source line: cross-step
  error access, unknown error field, error access outside RESCUE, RESUME with
  missing fallback step, RESUME with unknown field, RESUME with type mismatch,
  and missing rescue terminator. All produce single-line error messages.

### Emitters

- `python` and `mcp-server` emitters: helper signature gains `_err: BaseException`
  (mcp-server adds `_session` as before). Wrapper binds `as _err` and passes it.
  Substitutions `detect.error.message` → `str(_err)` and `detect.error.type` →
  `type(_err).__name__` emitted inline.

- For `RescueBlockIR` with `ResumeIR` terminator, both emitters dispatch to a
  RESUME squelette: helper returns `state[<rescued_field>]` (populated by the
  fallback call earlier in the chain), wrapper assigns the helper's return value
  to the rescued step's state slot. No `raise` after the helper call.

- `claude-cli` and `langgraph` continue to reject RESCUE at compile time
  (v0.8 rule unchanged).

### Cross-target invariant

- Flows without RESCUE continue to produce byte-identical output to v0.12.

- Flows with RESCUE produce a single-line diff vs v0.12: the helper signature
  gains `_err: BaseException` and the wrapper binds `as _err`. No other shape
  changes.

### Tests

- 19 new test cases: 7 parser, 8 IR validation, 3 Python emitter snapshots,
  3 MCP emitter snapshots, 1 E2E. Final count: 688 passed (was 669).

## v0.12.0 — 2026-05-12

### Language

- **Boolean composition in IF / WHILE conditions**
  (`docs/LANGUAGE_SPEC.md` §IF / ELSE, §WHILE): two new lowercase
  keywords `and` and `or` compose comparisons inside an IF or WHILE
  guard. Precedence follows Python — `and` binds tighter than `or`,
  parentheses override. Up to v0.11 the guard was restricted to a
  single comparison; the new grammar is a strict superset, so every
  existing flow keeps parsing unchanged.

  ```clio
  IF (report.confidence < 0.7 or report.confidence > 0.9)
     and report.category == "bug":
      human_review(report)
  ELSE:
      auto_route(report)
  ```

  Each leaf comparison is still validated independently (unknown
  state-field / sub-field rejected at IR-build time with the source
  line of the IF / WHILE block). `not` is **not** introduced in this
  release — invert a comparison by flipping its operator (`==` ↔
  `!=`, `<` ↔ `>=`, …).

### Parser

- `parse_condition` is now a recursive-descent expression parser with
  three levels: `or` < `and` < primary (`(...)` or atomic comparison).
  WHILE reuses the same entry point, so the two control-flow blocks
  stay in lock-step.

### IR

- New IR node `BoolOpIR(op, left, right)` (`op` ∈ `"and"` | `"or"`).
  `IfBlockIR.condition` and `WhileBlockIR.condition` now accept
  `ConditionIR | BoolOpIR`. Leaf `ConditionIR` is unchanged, so all
  existing IR consumers that read flat keys (`step_name`, `field`,
  `op`, `literal_value`, `literal_kind`) still work on single
  comparisons.

### Emitters

- `_python_helpers._python_condition_expr` walks the new IR tree
  recursively and renders boolean composition as parenthesised
  `(left) and (right)` / `(left) or (right)`, so the python /
  mcp-server / langgraph targets all emit valid Python whatever the
  IR nesting. LangGraph's router function evaluates the same
  expression and routes to the matching branch label.

### Graph viewer

- The Mermaid decision diamond (IF) and subgraph label (WHILE) now
  carry the full composed expression, parenthesised. `if_meta` /
  `while_meta` continue to expose flat keys for leaf comparisons
  (backward-compatible with the existing panel JS); composite
  conditions are serialised under a new `expr_tree` key (recursive
  dict) the viewer can render however it likes.

## v0.11.0 — 2026-05-10

### Language

- **`impl.mode: sql`** (`docs/LANGUAGE_SPEC.md` §impl.mode: sql): run a
  parameterized query against a database declared in `RESOURCES.databases`
  (see below) and referenced by name (`db: <name>`). Bindings use `:name`
  syntax keyed on `TAKES` field names. The runtime translates `:name` to
  the driver's native paramstyle (`:name` for sqlite stays as-is; `%(name)s`
  for psycopg / pymysql) and auto-maps result rows onto `GIVES` via
  `cursor.description`. Multi-line queries use a YAML-style `|` block scalar.
  `retry:` is **rejected at parse time** — wrap the step in `RESCUE` for
  retry-then-abort. `env:NAME` in the query body is rejected (SQL-injection
  vector); secrets belong in `RESOURCES.databases.<name>.url`. `GIVES` is
  required (the runtime can't map a SELECT without a target shape).
- **`RESOURCES.databases`** block: declares the SQL databases a flow can
  talk to. Each entry has `driver:` (one of `sqlite` / `postgres` /
  `mysql`) and `url:` (a path / connection string, optionally `env:NAME`).
  Database names must be unique within a flow (parse-time error on
  duplicates, mirroring `mcp_servers`); a database declared but never
  referenced emits a stderr warning ('dead spec' lint).
- **`GIVES`-driven result mapping** (no `columns:` field):
  - `List<{...}>` → list of records, fields keyed by SELECT column / alias.
  - `{...}` (single record) → one row expected (zero / many → runtime error).
  - Primitive (`int`, `str`, ...) → one row × one column.
  - DML (`INSERT` / `UPDATE` / `DELETE`, detected via `cursor.description is None`) → `cursor.rowcount`, regardless of declared `GIVES`.
- **Multi-line `|` block scalar**: the lexer now recognises
  `key: |\n  body...\n` as a literal-block scalar (YAML clip mode) and
  emits a single `BLOCK_SCALAR` token. Common leading indent is stripped,
  empty lines are preserved, trailing blanks are trimmed. Used by
  `impl.sql.query` today; available to any future field that needs a
  raw multi-line string.
- New keywords: `sql`, `databases`.

### IR

- New AST/IR nodes: `SqlImpl` / `SqlImplIR`, `DatabaseSpec` /
  `DatabaseSpecIR`. `ResourcesDecl` / `ResourcesIR` extended with a
  `databases` field (default `()` for back-compat).
- New cross-validation: every `impl.sql.db` must reference a declared
  database (compile error if not); every `impl.sql` STEP must declare
  `GIVES`; a database declared but never referenced emits a stderr
  warning.

### Emitters

- `python` and `mcp-server`: emit `_sql.execute(_db_spec, _query, _params,
  gives_shape='...')` per step. The new `clio/runtime/sql.py` module is
  bundled into `clio_runtime/` whenever a flow has any `impl.sql` step.
  Long-lived per-database connections live in a singleton dict keyed by
  database name; a per-connection `threading.Lock` serialises access so
  `FOR EACH ... PARALLEL` blocks share the connection safely (sqlite is
  single-thread; psycopg / pymysql are connection-serialised anyway).
  Connections close at process exit via `atexit`.
- `claude-cli` and `langgraph`: **rejected at compile time** with a
  pointer to `--target python` / `--target mcp-server`. The bash
  orchestrator has no shared connection cache; LangGraph multi-step
  branches are deferred.

### Runtime

- `clio/runtime/sql.py` — single module covering the three drivers. Lazy
  imports keep `psycopg` / `pymysql` optional (`sqlite3` is stdlib). The
  named-binding regex uses a lookbehind (`(?<!:):`) so PostgreSQL `::cast`
  operators (e.g. `value::int`) are preserved unchanged. `env:NAME` in
  the URL field is resolved at connection-open time; missing env var
  raises `KeyError` with a clear message. mysql URLs are parsed via
  `urlparse` into `pymysql.connect(host=, port=, user=, password=,
  database=)` — credentials embedded in `mysql://user:pass@host/db` work
  out of the box. Friendly `RuntimeError` if a driver dep is missing
  (never an opaque `ImportError`).

### Examples

- `examples/sql_demo.clio` — minimal sqlite-backed customer-summary
  flow showing both the `RESOURCES.databases` block and the `query: |`
  block scalar.

### Tests

- 643 passing (+54 since v0.10): 6 lexer block-scalar, 11 parser sql /
  databases, 6 IR sql validation, 22 runtime sql (sqlite in-memory:
  list_of_records / record / primitive / DML rowcount, named-binding
  translation per driver, env-URL resolution, friendly errors when
  drivers are missing), 9 emitter sql (python smoke + mcp-server smoke
  + ast.parse + per-target rejection on claude-cli + langgraph).

## v0.10.0 — 2026-05-10

### Language

- **`impl.mode: mcp_tool`** (`docs/LANGUAGE_SPEC.md` §impl.mode: mcp_tool):
  call a tool exposed by an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server. The
  step references a server declared in `RESOURCES.mcp_servers` (see
  below) by name and passes a `tool` + `args` dict. `${var}` in any
  string-typed `args` value resolves from `TAKES`; numeric / bool /
  null leaves pass through; nested dicts and lists are walked
  recursively. `parse: json` (default) `json.loads` the first text
  content block and validates against `GIVES`; `parse: text` returns
  the raw text as a `str` (compile error if `GIVES` is not `str`).
  `timeout:` defaults to `60s`. `retry:` is rejected at parse time —
  wrap the step in a `RESCUE` handler if you need retry-then-abort.
  `env:NAME` is *not* allowed in `args` (secrets belong in the server
  spec, not the tool arguments).
- **`RESOURCES.mcp_servers`** block: declares MCP servers a flow can
  talk to. Three transports — `stdio` (subprocess: `command` / `args`
  / `env`), `sse` (Server-Sent Events: `url` / `headers`), and `http`
  (streamable HTTP: `url` / `headers`). `env:` and `headers.*` values
  may use `env:NAME` for secrets. URLs must be `https://` unless host
  is `localhost` / `127.0.0.1`. Mixing transport-incompatible fields
  (e.g. `command` on a `sse` spec) is a parse-time error.
- New keywords: `mcp_tool`, `mcp_servers`, `stdio`, `sse`, `http`.

### IR

- New AST/IR nodes: `McpToolImpl` / `McpToolImplIR`, sealed
  `McpServerSpec` / `McpServerSpecIR` hierarchy with `Stdio*`, `Sse*`,
  `Http*` variants. `ResourcesDecl` / `ResourcesIR` extended with a
  `mcp_servers` field.
- New cross-validations: every `impl.mcp_tool.server` must reference a
  declared server (compile error if not); `parse: text` requires
  GIVES of type `str` (compile error otherwise); a server declared
  but never referenced emits a `stderr` warning ('dead spec').

### Emitters

- `python` and `mcp-server`: emit `_mcp.call_tool_sync(server_spec,
  tool, args, takes, timeout=..., parse=...)` per step. The new
  `clio/runtime/mcp_client.py` module is bundled into
  `clio_runtime/` (along with `rest.py` for the templating helper)
  whenever a flow has any `mcp_tool` step. Long-lived per-server
  clients are kept in a daemon-thread asyncio loop (sync ↔ async
  bridge); `atexit` tears them down at process exit.
- `claude-cli`: each `mcp_tool` step is a standalone Python script
  that runs `asyncio.run(_mcp.call_tool_async(...))`. Per-step
  bootstrap — claude-cli's bash orchestrator has no place to hold a
  long-lived client across subprocess invocations. The runtime
  bundle now also copies `mcp_client.py`.

### Runtime

- New `clio/runtime/mcp_client.py` (≈ 250 lines, lazy-imports the
  `mcp` SDK). `render_args(args, takes)` substitutes `${var}` over
  scalar/dict/list args; `_resolve_env(value)` resolves `env:NAME`
  in headers/env entries. Public API: `call_tool_async` (used by
  `claude-cli` step scripts) and `call_tool_sync` (used by the
  `python` / `mcp-server` emitted code).

### Documentation

- New §RESOURCES.mcp_servers and §impl.mode: mcp_tool sections in
  `docs/LANGUAGE_SPEC.md`. Implementation-status table updated:
  `mcp_tool` is now ✅ on parser / IR / python / mcp-server / claude-cli.
- New cookbook recipe (`docs/manual/03-cookbook.md` §12) — calling
  MCP tools across the three transports with full templating example.
- Eight new troubleshooting entries (`docs/manual/06-troubleshooting.md`)
  for the `mcp_tool` and `mcp_servers` parse-time errors and the
  runtime "mcp SDK not installed" diagnostic.
- New `examples/mcp_tool.clio` exercising all 3 transports + nested
  args + `parse: text` vs `parse: json`.

### Tests

- 16 new parser tests (transport variants, field validation, retry
  rejection, parse value, duplicate name, URL https requirement).
- 5 new IR tests (build, server resolution, parse:text+non-str
  rejection, dead-spec warning, sse/http variants).
- 7 new emitter tests (3 python + 2 mcp-server + 2 claude-cli) —
  covers code generation, runtime bundling, env-list-of-tuples
  rendering.
- 9 new runtime tests (`tests/test_runtime_mcp_client.py`) on
  `render_args` recursion, `_resolve_env` whole-string semantics,
  and the lazy-import friendly error.
- Suite total: 587 (up from 551 at v0.9.0).

## v0.9.0 — 2026-05-10

### Viewer

- **Replay an `events.jsonl` trace inside the HTML viewer**
  (`docs/manual/05-cli-reference.md` §`graph` / `html`). The toolbar
  now exposes a "Drop events.jsonl" target; once a trace is loaded, a
  control bar appears with play/pause/prev/next/restart, a `0.1×→10×`
  speed slider (default `2×`, scaled against real `ts` deltas), an
  auto-follow side panel for the active step, and a stats summary
  (`done` / `fail` / `total` walltime). Active steps pulse with a
  colored stroke; failed `step_end` events get a red border. No
  network calls — everything runs locally on the dropped file.
- The replay UI is non-invasive: REST-less / event-less flows render
  identically to v0.8 (the control bar stays hidden until a file is
  dropped).

### Tests

- 6 new viewer tests asserting dropzone, control-bar elements, CSS
  classes (`.replay-active`, `.replay-done`, `.replay-fail`), the
  `Replay` JS module entry points, and the manual-click auto-follow
  bypass. Suite total: 550 (up from 544).

### Language

- **`impl.rest` now parses and honors `query`, `headers`, and `body`**
  (`docs/LANGUAGE_SPEC.md` §impl.mode: rest). Inline-dict values support
  `${var}` substitution from `TAKES` and full-value `env:NAME` resolution
  from `os.environ`. Five body forms — JSON dict, raw string, `"@./file"`
  (content-type inferred from extension), `{form: {...}}` for
  `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, and `{multipart: {...}}` for
  `multipart/form-data` (where `"@./path"` values become file parts).
  Forbidden: `body` on `GET`, mixing `form` + `multipart`.
- **`retry: {...}` replaces the parsed-but-ignored `retries: N` scalar**.
  Required field `attempts`; optional `backoff` (`exponential` |
  `constant`, default exponential), `base` (default 0.1s), `cap`
  (default 30s), `on` (default `["5xx", "429", "timeout"]`,
  also accepts `"network"`). Honored at runtime with `Retry-After`
  precedence on the computed delay. The bare scalar `retries: N` is now
  a parse-time error with a migration hint.
- New AST + IR nodes: `RetryPolicy` / `RetryPolicyIR`, sealed
  `RestBody` / `RestBodyIR` hierarchy with `JsonBody`, `RawBody`,
  `FileBody`, `FormBody`, `MultipartBody` variants.
- New parser primitives: inline-dict (`{k: v, ...}`) and inline-list
  (`[v, ...]`) value parsers, used for the new REST fields. Bool/null
  literals (`true`/`false`/`null`/`none`) are JSON-typed only inside
  inline dicts/lists; bareword `parse: none` etc. keep their string value.
- Inline-dict keys may now also be quoted strings, so users can write
  HTTP headers with non-identifier characters
  (`{"Content-Type": "application/json"}`).

### Emitters

- `python` and `mcp-server`: emit `requests.request(...)` with `params`,
  `headers`, JSON / raw / file / form / multipart body construction, and
  a retry loop wrapping the call when `impl.retry` is set. A new
  `clio/runtime/rest.py` module is bundled into `clio_runtime/`
  (templating + retry + content-type inference + file-body reading).
  REST-less flows still produce identical output (no spurious helper
  copy).
- `claude-cli`: each REST step now imports the same bundled
  `clio_runtime/rest.py` (added to `sys.path` at startup) and emits the
  same kwargs construction + retry loop. The runtime bundle is now
  copied whenever the flow has any REST or judgment step (not only
  judgment, as in v0.8).

### Documentation

- `docs/LANGUAGE_SPEC.md` §impl.mode: rest fully rewritten with the new
  syntax (templating rules, `body` table of 5 forms, `retry` field
  semantics) and updated implementation-status row.
- The legacy "v0 limitations carried forward" entries about
  `query/headers/body` and `retries` are removed.

### Tests

- 31 new unit tests for `clio.runtime.rest` (templating, content-type,
  retry classification, backoff, Retry-After parsing).
- 14 new parser tests (query/headers/body forms, retry validation,
  scalar-retries rejection, GET-with-body rejection,
  form/multipart-combined rejection).
- 13 new emitter tests (5 for python, 4 for claude-cli, plus runtime-
  copy assertions). Suite total: 543 (up from 483 at v0.8).

## v0.8.0 — 2026-05-10

### Language

- **RESCUE handler** (`docs/LANGUAGE_SPEC.md` §RESCUE handler): top-level
  block attached to a STEP that runs if the STEP raises after its
  `ON_FAIL` chain exhausts. Body is a chain of step calls ending in
  mandatory `abort("message")`, so you can notify/log/cleanup before
  aborting. Targets: python, mcp-server. langgraph and claude-cli reject
  at compile time.
- New keyword `RESCUE`.
- New IR validations: unknown step / nested step / duplicate rescue /
  abort clash with `ON_FAIL` / non-terminal abort / abort outside
  rescue body. All errors include the source line.
- `abort("...")` is now a recognised synthetic step call inside rescue
  bodies (still rejected outside).

### Emitters

- `python` and `mcp-server` emit a `try/except FlowAborted: raise; except
  Exception: <handler>; raise` wrap around protected STEPs and a
  `def _rescue_<step>(state)` (sync) / `async def _rescue_<step>(state,
  _session=None)` (async) helper containing the rescue body. `abort` is
  rendered as `raise FlowAborted("msg")`. `class FlowAborted(Exception)`
  is defined locally in the emitted `flow.py` (importable as
  `from <pkg>.flow import FlowAborted` for downstream catchers), gated
  on rescues being non-empty so flows without RESCUE produce
  byte-identical output to v0.7.

### Viewer

- `clio graph --format mermaid|html` now renders RESCUE blocks as a
  red-tinted `rescue_<step>` node connected by a dotted "fails" edge,
  with the body sub-flow ending in an `abort_<step>` circle. New
  `rescue_meta` is exposed to the JS via `__RESCUE_META_JSON__` for
  future side-panel enrichment.

### Documentation

- New §RESCUE handler in `docs/LANGUAGE_SPEC.md` with grammar,
  composition table (ON_FAIL × RESCUE), targets, v0.8 limitations, and
  a worked example.
- Manual updates: `02-language-tour.md` (RESCUE section), `03-cookbook.md`
  (critical LLM pipeline recipe), `06-troubleshooting.md` (2 new entries
  for the terminal-abort and ON_FAIL-clash errors).
- Narrative example at `docs/LANGUAGE_SPEC.md` lines ~649-657 migrated
  from the deferred `IF X.FAILS:` form to the actual `RESCUE` form.

### Tests

- 24 new tests covering parser, IR, emitters, and viewer for RESCUE.
- Suite total: 481 (up from 457 at v0.7).

## v0.7.0 — 2026-05-10

### Language

- **IF / ELSE conditional branching** (control flow). The condition is a
  single comparison `<state_field>.<sub_field> <op> <literal>` where `<op>`
  is one of `== != < <= > >=` and `<literal>` is a string, number,
  bare-ident (enum value), or the bool literals `true` / `false`. The
  state_field must be a CONTRACT so it has nested sub-fields exposed to
  the comparator. ELSE is optional. No boolean conjunction (`and`/`or`)
  and no `.FAILS` shorthand in v0.7 — those are deferred. Compiles to
  python (native `if/else`), mcp-server (same, async), and langgraph
  (`add_conditional_edges` + router function). LangGraph requires both
  ELSE and exactly one step call per branch in v0.7 (multi-step branches
  + optional ELSE are planned for v0.8).
- **MATCH / CASE / DEFAULT multi-way dispatch** on an enum sub-field of
  a CONTRACT. CASE values must match enum variants exactly; duplicate
  CASE values are rejected at IR build time. DEFAULT must come last and
  is optional in python/mcp-server, required in langgraph. Compiles to
  python/mcp-server via Python 3.10+ `match: case` and to langgraph
  via a `_match_<state_field>_<sub_field>` router function returning
  the next node name; `add_conditional_edges` wires the prev node to
  every arm's first step.
- **WHILE … MAX bounded loop** on python and mcp-server (langgraph
  rejects in v0.7). The body re-evaluates the condition each iteration;
  the loop exits when the condition turns false **or** after MAX
  iterations (whichever comes first). MAX is a mandatory positive
  integer — unbounded loops are forbidden at parse time. Emitted as
  `for _i in range(MAX): if not cond: break; body`. Body must update
  the state field referenced by the condition for progress (caller-side
  invariant).
- New tokens: `DOT` (`.` for `state_field.sub_field`).
- New keywords: `IF`, `ELSE`, `MATCH`, `CASE`, `DEFAULT`, `WHILE`, `MAX`.
- New IR nodes: `ConditionIR`, `IfBlockIR`, `MatchBlockIR`, `MatchCaseIR`,
  `WhileBlockIR`. The IR's FlowIR.chain union now includes all four
  control-flow primitives (`CallIR | ForEachIR | IfBlockIR | MatchBlockIR
  | WhileBlockIR`).

### Examples

- New `examples/feedback_routing.clio` — content-moderation + categorical
  routing pipeline that demonstrates IF/ELSE branching + MATCH/CASE
  dispatch in a realistic triage workflow. Compiles to python and
  mcp-server (langgraph rejects: nested MATCH inside the IF then-branch
  is a multi-step branch). Companion fixture at `examples/feedback.json`.

### Viewer

- HTML viewer renders IF as a Mermaid decision diamond (`if_N{"IF cond"}`)
  with `yes` / `no` labelled edges, MATCH as a diamond with one labelled
  edge per arm (`-- "spam" -->`, `-- "default" -->`), and WHILE as a
  cluster (subgraph) with the body inside and a `WHILE cond MAX N` label.
  `if_meta`, `match_meta`, `while_meta` are exposed as JS constants for
  future viewer enrichments (chip-pill banners, iteration counter, etc.).
  Vanilla `--format mermaid` and `--format dot` silently skip the new
  control-flow nodes (rich HTML viewer is the canonical visualisation).

### Emitters

- New `--target langgraph` emitter compiles a `.clio` source to a Python
  package whose `flow.py` builds a `langgraph.graph.StateGraph` (LangGraph
  1.0+). Each `STEP` becomes a node function `(state: State) -> dict`;
  `State` is a `TypedDict` aggregating every TAKES/GIVES field. `retry(N)`
  translates to `RetryPolicy(max_attempts=N)` on `add_node`. Step files
  are reused verbatim from the python target; only the orchestrator
  changes. Bridges CLIO into the LangChain ecosystem.
- v0 LangGraph scope: linear FLOW, `judgment.api.anthropic` (default
  `invoke`), `exact` (code stub / shell / rest), CONTRACT + Pydantic,
  CACHE, `retry(N)` + `abort`. Rejected at compile time with clear
  messages: FOR EACH (any kind), `invoke.cli`,
  `invoke.api.openai/bedrock/vertex`, ON_FAIL `escalate`/`fallback`.
  Send-API support for FOR EACH PARALLEL is planned for v0.7.

### Documentation

- New structured user manual at `docs/manual/`: getting-started tutorial,
  language tour, cookbook (7 recipes referencing every polished
  example), targets guide, CLI reference, and troubleshooting page.
  Linked from the main README. Complements the exhaustive
  `LANGUAGE_SPEC.md` reference with a parcours pédagogique.

## v0.6.0 — 2026-05-09

### Language

- `ASSERT` expressions now accept **chained comparators** —
  `0.0 <= score <= 1.0` desugars to `(0.0 <= score) and (score <= 1.0)`
  per Python semantics. Left-associative: `a < b < c < d` becomes
  `((a<b) and (b<c)) and (c<d)`. The chain must reference a single
  field (multi-field asserts remain rejected at emit time). Examples
  `rag_basic.clio` and `rag_selfcontained.clio` updated to use the new
  form (`0.0 <= score <= 1.0` instead of just the lower bound).
- `RESOURCES target:` now accepts `python` and `mcp-server` in addition
  to `claude-cli` (previously only `claude-cli` was allowed at parse
  time, forcing examples that compile to other targets to omit
  `RESOURCES` entirely). The `target:` field is informational — the
  `--target` CLI flag still drives the actual emitter selection.
- `RESOURCES.models:` is now optional when `target` is `python` or
  `mcp-server` (those targets take per-step model overrides via
  `invoke.api.model:`, so a flow-wide model chain is moot). Still
  required for `target: claude-cli` since the haiku→sonnet→opus
  escalation chain depends on it.

### Emitters

- Python emitter: emit `from .. import contracts` in step modules whose
  TAKES or GIVES reference any `CONTRACT` (impl.code stub, impl.shell,
  impl.rest). Without this, the qualified `list[contracts.Foo]` return
  annotation was an unresolved name — harmless under
  `from __future__ import annotations` but caught by
  `typing.get_type_hints`. Visible in the RAG self-contained example
  and in `ticket_routing` (impl.shell + parse:json).

### CLI

- `clio graph <file.clio> --format html` emits a single self-contained HTML
  viewer: the FLOW rendered by the existing Mermaid backend (loaded
  client-side from the mermaid.js ESM CDN), plus a click-to-inspect side
  panel that surfaces each step's TAKES, GIVES, mode, line, CACHE, ON_FAIL,
  IMPL, INVOKE, and the JSON Schema of every CONTRACT it references. No
  build step, no server. Open the HTML in any browser. The panel is
  populated via DOM API (textContent / appendChild), never `innerHTML`, so
  step or contract names containing HTML metacharacters are safe.
- `clio graph --format html` viewer redesign — Tabloid-grade rich cards.
  Cream paper background with a charcoal dot grid; each node is rendered
  as a Tabloid-style card with a colour-coded tinted head (icon + step
  name + kicker), a Lucide-style mode icon (sparkles for `judgment`, `>_`
  for `impl.shell`, code chevrons for `impl.code`, arrows for
  `impl.rest`), and a meta footer surfacing the most informative
  attributes (cache TTL, retry policy, gives type, parse mode). Mode
  classes — `judgment` / `exact-shell` / `exact-rest` / `exact-code` —
  drive both the node card and the detail panel theming. The kicker shows
  the next-level distinguishing detail (`cli`, `haiku`, `sonnet`, `cat`,
  `jq`, `GET`, `python`) instead of repeating the mode the icon already
  conveys. Typography: Geist Sans + Geist Mono (Google Fonts). Icons use
  the head's hue darkened (not the saturated brand colour), enforced via
  `!important` to defeat Mermaid's label-colour cascade. Vanilla
  `to_mermaid()` (used for `--format mermaid`) is unchanged so GitHub
  rendering is unaffected.
- `clio graph --format html` viewer — `FOR EACH … PARALLEL` cluster
  styling: soft cream-tinted wrapper with rounded corners, plus a chip
  pill flottante astride the top border (fieldset-legend style) showing
  a `git-branch` icon, the loop signature `FOR EACH t IN tickets`, and a
  `PARALLEL` kicker. Implemented as a post-render JS injection that
  swaps the placeholder cluster label for a `<template>`-cloned banner
  and resizes the `foreignObject` to fit. Amber/rust accent
  (`oklch(48% 0.155 60)`) — distinct from the four mode hues
  (judgment/shell/rest/code). The Mermaid source label is unchanged
  (`subgraph foreach_N["FOR EACH … [parallel]"]`), so vanilla
  `--format mermaid` output and existing tests stay valid.

### Examples

- `examples/ticket_routing.clio` — support-ticket routing pipeline. Three
  CONTRACTs (`support_ticket`, `classified_ticket`, `routing_summary`),
  multi-field structured judgment output (two bounded `enum(...)` fields plus
  a float with a numeric ASSERT), `FOR EACH ... PARALLEL AS classifications`
  to scale per-ticket classification, and a JUDGMENT summary step that turns
  the typed list into a narrative digest. Zero manual edit (loader uses
  `impl.shell` + `parse: json` on `examples/tickets.json`). Compiles to
  `--target python` and `--target mcp-server`; rejected by `--target
  claude-cli` (no PARALLEL support).
- `examples/tickets.json` — 6 French support tickets fixture
  (`{id, title, body}`), used by `ticket_routing.clio`.

## v0.5.0 — 2026-05-08

### Language

- `impl.mode: shell` accepts a new optional `parse:` field. Values: `none`
  (default — stdout returned as `str`, v0.4 behaviour) and `json` (stdout is
  passed through `json.loads` before `GIVES` validation, enabling
  `List<...>` / `Dict<...>` GIVES types from a `cat`-style command).
  Backward-compatible: every existing `.clio` file parses unchanged.

### Examples

- `examples/rag_basic.clio` — RAG-like pipeline (LLM-as-retriever) with the
  manual-edit loader pattern. Demonstrates 3 CONTRACTs, numeric ASSERT,
  multi-input judgment steps, and `citations: List<int>` for grounded answers.
- `examples/rag_selfcontained.clio` — same pipeline, zero-manual-edit using
  the new `impl.shell.parse: json`. Pair with `examples/faq.json`.
- `examples/faq.txt`, `examples/faq.json`, `examples/question.txt` — data
  fixtures shared by both variants.
- `examples/README.md` — new section 4 comparing the two variants.

### Resume

- **W5 (short-term): Step-granularity resume.** Python emitter writes
  `state.json` after each top-level chain item (atomic via
  `os.replace(tmp, path)`). The emitted `__main__.py` accepts
  `--from-step N` (1-based; reads `state.json` or `$CLIO_STATE_FILE`)
  and skips items 1..N. Granularity is one top-level chain item: a
  `FOR EACH` (sequential or PARALLEL) counts as one regardless of
  internal iterations. Strict fail-fast on edge cases. Targets v1:
  python only.

## v0.4.0 — 2026-05-08

### Language

- New `FOR EACH ... PARALLEL AS <name>:` syntax fans a single STEP across a collection in parallel and binds the typed result list to `state[<name>]`. Default concurrency cap = 10. Supported by the python target (`concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor`) and the mcp-server target (`asyncio.gather` + `Semaphore`); rejected at compile time by claude-cli. Body restricted to one step call in v1; nested PARALLEL rejected; failure mode = fail-fast (per-task ON_FAIL still applies).

### Language — v0.2 spec landed

- New per-step `impl:` block on EXACT steps: `mode: code | rest | shell`. `impl.mode: rest` describes an HTTP call with `method`, `url`, optional `response_path`, `timeout`, `retries`. `impl.mode: shell` runs an argv-style command with `cmd` (quoted, `shlex.split` at compile time) and optional `timeout`. The remaining modes (`sql`, `mcp_tool`, `binary`) are specified but not yet parsed.
- New per-step `invoke:` block on JUDGMENT steps: `mode: cli | api`. `invoke.mode: api` decomposes into `protocol` (`anthropic | openai | bedrock | vertex`), `base_url`, `model`, `auth`, `temperature`, `max_tokens`, `timeout`, `retries`. The protocol/base_url/model/auth split handles cases like Gemini-via-LiteLLM-via-OpenAI-compat.
- New per-step `LANG:` field accepted by the parser (`python | rust | go | node | bash | auto`). Specced since v0.1, now actually wired through AST and IR.
- New control flow: `FOR EACH <var> IN <collection>:` with an indented body. Loop variable binds to the collection's inner type and is visible to `step(x=item)` kwargs as a state-like reference.
- Refined semantic distinction between EXACT and JUDGMENT: EXACT = compiler can name the function (code, URL, shell, SQL, tool reference); JUDGMENT = invoked by prompt in an LLM. A REST call is therefore EXACT, not JUDGMENT.

### Emitters

- New `target: mcp-server` emitter compiles a `.clio` source into a runnable MCP (Model Context Protocol) server. Each `FLOW` becomes a tool registered with the official `mcp` Python SDK. Judgment steps delegate to the MCP client via `sampling/createMessage` — no API key on the server, no `anthropic`/`openai` SDK dep. inputSchema derives from the first step's TAKES (literal FLOW kwargs become defaults); outputSchema derives from the last step's GIVES. Steps with `invoke.protocol: anthropic|openai|bedrock|vertex` are rejected at compile time with a pointer to `--target python`. Reuses the python emitter's helpers for FOR EACH, CACHE, ON_FAIL, impl.rest, impl.shell. Emitted package ships a README with the client-config snippet.
- Python emitter: routes `invoke.protocol` between Anthropic SDK (default) and OpenAI SDK (chat.completions API). With `protocol: openai` + `base_url`, the same emission unblocks LiteLLM, OpenRouter, Ollama, vLLM, Together, Groq via OpenAI-compat. `pyproject.toml` adds `openai>=1.0` only when needed.
- Python emitter: emits `impl.mode: rest` as a step that calls `requests.request(...)` with optional `response_path` traversal (regex-walked, supports `.field` and `[N]` segments). `pyproject.toml` adds `requests>=2.31` only when needed.
- Python emitter: emits `FOR EACH` as `for var in state['coll']:` with body calls binding the loop variable as a local kwarg (not via `state[...]`). Nested loops supported.
- claude-cli emitter: emits `impl.mode: rest` as a standalone Python step using `requests` (the project ships no pyproject.toml, so `requests` is a documented operational requirement at run time).
- claude-cli emitter: emits `FOR EACH` as `mapfile -t _CLIO_ITER_N < <(jq <flag> '.<coll>[]' state.json)` then a bash `for` loop. `jq -r` is used for primitive collections (`List<str>`, etc.) and `jq -c` for object/list collections, so values arrive at body steps in the right shape. Body calls reference loop variables via `$var` rather than re-querying `state.json`.
- Both emitters reject explicitly at compile time the unsupported combinations: `protocol: bedrock`/`vertex`, `invoke.mode: cli` on python target, judgment steps inside `FOR EACH` on claude-cli target.
- Both emitters: `impl.mode: rest` substitutes TAKES into the `url` via `${var}` placeholders (`url.replace('${name}', str(name))` per TAKES). Templating is skipped when the url has no placeholder, preserving the existing static-url emission shape. Headers/body templating and `query`/`headers`/`body` field parsing remain on the v0.4+ backlog.
- Both emitters: `impl.mode: shell` emits a step that calls `subprocess.run([...], capture_output=True, text=True, check=True, timeout=...)`. The argv list is `shlex.split` at compile time and `${var}` placeholders are substituted token-by-token at runtime — `shell=False` keeps shell-injection out of the picture by construction. Stdout becomes the step's `GIVES`. No pipes/redirections (wrap a pipeline in a script).
- Python emitter: `pydantic>=2` is added to the emitted `pyproject.toml` only when at least one CONTRACT is declared. Skeleton flows (no contracts) no longer pull in an unused dependency.

### Observability

- **W2 (short-term): Structured JSON-Line logging.** New `clio_runtime/logging.py`
  module copied verbatim into emitted projects. Opt-in via `CLIO_LOG=1`,
  destination via `CLIO_LOG_FILE` (default stderr). Six event types: `flow_start`/
  `flow_end`, `step_start`/`step_end`, `parallel_block_start`/`parallel_block_end`.
  `python` and `mcp-server` targets instrumented; `claude-cli` deferred to v2.
  Schema is flat and OTel-mappable. ContextVar propagates `flow` natively
  through asyncio; ThreadPoolExecutor uses `contextvars.copy_context().run`.

### CLI

- New `clio graph <source>` subcommand that renders the FLOW as a Mermaid (default) or Graphviz DOT source. EXACT steps render as rectangles, JUDGMENT steps as parallelograms; FOR EACH renders as a labelled subgraph in Mermaid and as a dashed labelled edge in DOT (cluster-with-`lhead` machinery skipped on purpose). Output goes to stdout or to `--output FILE`. Designed for paste-into-GitHub-PR rendering since GitHub renders Mermaid natively.
- New `clio gen <description>` subcommand that turns a natural-language description into a valid `.clio` source via Anthropic SDK (Sonnet 4.6 by default). Compile-correct loop: parse + IR build validate the LLM output; on failure, a single retry feeds the previous attempt and the line/column error back to the model. After the retry budget, `GenerationError` is raised — the CLI prints the failed attempt as `# `-commented stderr lines so the user can paste-and-fix. The `anthropic` package is an optional `[gen]` extra; `compile`/`check`/`graph` keep their zero-runtime-deps. Reads description from arg, `--from-file`, or stdin; writes to stdout or `--output FILE`. Auth via `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` env var.

### Refactor

- Split `clio/emitters/python.py` (was 991 lines): module-level helpers moved to `clio/emitters/_python_helpers.py` (375 lines). The `PythonEmitter` class stays in `python.py` (now 649 lines).
- Split `clio/emitters/claude_cli.py` (was 691 lines): helpers moved to `clio/emitters/_claude_cli_helpers.py` (249 lines). `claude_cli.py` is now 484 lines.
- `python.py` imports `_inline_schema` and `_render_prompt` from `_claude_cli_helpers` directly rather than through claude_cli re-export.

### Examples

- New `examples/entities.clio` (named-entity recognition + summary) demonstrating the language is not churn-specific. Three steps (two EXACT, one JUDGMENT), nested record types (`List<{kind: str, count: int}>`), enum + float fields. Compiles to both targets with no manual edits beyond filling EXACT step bodies.
- New `examples/classify_corpus.clio` combining `FOR EACH` + `invoke.protocol: openai` (LiteLLM proxy → Gemini). Two steps + one CONTRACT with ASSERT. Compiles via `--target python` only (claude-cli rejects openai protocol). Emits an `openai>=1.0`/`pydantic>=2` package — no `anthropic`, no `requests` — and a `flow.py` that chains `load_lines()` then `for line in state['lines']: classify(text=line)`.

### Documentation

- New `docs/POSITIONING.md`: 5 structural differentiators vs LangGraph and n8n (compiler-not-runtime, declarative source, EXACT/JUDGMENT split, multi-target, CONTRACT-as-primitive), 6 honest weaknesses with per-weakness action plan (W1–W6), and a bridge-target policy. n8n and LangChain compilation targets explicitly refused; LangGraph emitter conditional on python reaching W2/W5.
- `docs/COMPILATION_TARGETS.md`: new "Targets at a glance" table covering 15 targets (2 implemented, 4 documented future, 9 candidates). Fixes the line claiming exact steps could emit `.sh` (only `.py` was ever implemented).
- `docs/LANGUAGE_SPEC.md`: bumped to v0.2 with the new `impl:`/`invoke:` block specs, semantic note, override semantics, and an implementation-status table reflecting per-target coverage.

### Tests

- 294 tests + 2 e2e gated (was 263 + 2). +31 tests covering mcp-server emitter: file-tree structure, tool registration, sampling/createMessage judgment emission, inputSchema/outputSchema derivation, refused protocol combinations, FOR EACH and CACHE and ON_FAIL and impl.rest/shell wiring, emitted README content, and pyproject.toml dependency shape.

### Repo hygiene

- Track `uv.lock` in version control (per the gitignore comment, recommended for binary packages to ensure reproducibility).
- Add `.understand-anything/` to `.gitignore` (knowledge-graph cache generated locally by the skill).

### CI

- GitHub Actions workflow runs the pytest suite on push and PR to `main` (Python 3.12). E2E tests stay gated behind `CLIO_E2E=1`.

### Python emitter — latent fixes from v0.3 reviews

- Reject CONTRACT field names colliding with Pydantic v2 reserved attributes (`model_config`, `model_dump`, …) at emit time instead of crashing the generated `contracts.py` at import with `PydanticUserError`.
- Reject CONTRACT ASSERTs referencing more than one field at emit time instead of generating a `@field_validator` body that `NameError`s at runtime.
- Qualify `ContractRef` as `contracts.X` in step signatures so `typing.get_type_hints()` resolves under `from __future__ import annotations`.
- Treat stale cache hits (re-validation failure) as a cache miss and fall through to a fresh SDK call instead of crashing with `pydantic.ValidationError`.

### Parser

- Fix `IndexError` in `parse_term` when a bare identifier is the last token of an expression (`a > b`). Unblocks ASSERTs comparing two identifiers — the python emitter rejects them as multi-field, but the IR is now well-formed.

### Tests

- 121 tests + 2 e2e gated (was 116 + 2).

## v0.3.0 — 2026-05-04

Adds a second emitter target (`python`) producing a runnable Python package (Anthropic SDK + Pydantic v2) from the same IR. Validates the "IR is target-independent" architecture claim.

### Compiler

- `python -m clio compile --target python` — new target.
- Same `.clio` source, same IR; only the emitter differs.

### Emitted Python project

- Layout: `pyproject.toml` + importable package + `python -m <pkg>` CLI entry.
- Contracts → Pydantic v2 BaseModel classes (with `@field_validator` for `ASSERT`).
- Exact steps → typed function stubs (`NotImplementedError` body).
- Judgment steps → full implementations: Anthropic SDK call + Pydantic validation + `CACHE` + full `ON_FAIL` strategy chain.
- `clio_runtime/cache.py` copied verbatim — same on-disk cache format as the bash target; caches are interchangeable between targets.
- Dependencies: `anthropic>=0.40`, `pydantic>=2`. Runtime needs only Python 3.12+.
- Emitted SDK calls include a strict JSON-only system prompt to align behavior with `claude -p`.

### Tests

- Golden tests for: skeleton, contracts, exact stubs, cache wrapping, full strategy chain, fallback resolution.
- Pydantic round-trip validation tests.
- SDK monkeypatch tests for retry/escalate/fallback behavior (no network).
- E2E gated test: real `claude -p`, cache replay verified via SDK monkeypatch on the second run.

### Out of scope (planned for later)

Async / parallel step execution, streaming responses, tool_use, provider-neutral SDK, multi-FLOW per source, persistent state.

## v0.2.0 — 2026-05-03

Adds reproducibility (`CACHE`) and resilience (`ON_FAIL`) on `judgment` steps.

### Language

- `CACHE: on | off | ttl(<int><s|m|h|d>)` — judgment steps only.
- `ON_FAIL: <strategy> (then <strategy>)*` — judgment steps only. Strategies:
  - `retry(N)` — N additional attempts on the current model
  - `escalate` — one attempt on the next model in `RESOURCES.models`
  - `fallback(<step_name>)` — run a different STEP with identical TAKES/GIVES; cycles rejected at compile time
  - `abort("<msg>")` — stop with a clear error
- Fallback compat is checked structurally at IR build time (TAKES name+type and GIVES name+type must match).
- Implicit abort if all strategies are exhausted without a terminal `abort`.

### Runtime

- New `clio_runtime/cache.py` (key = SHA256 over step+model+rendered_prompt+inlined_schema). Atomic file writes. Project-local `.cache/` (override via `CLIO_CACHE_DIR`).
- `run.sh` gains a `_clio_run_attempt` bash helper at the top (one definition per emitted project).
- Bash variable names are now suffixed with the step index (`PROMPT_02`, `RESPONSE_02`, …) to avoid collision in multi-judgment-step flows.

### Tests

- 12 new unit tests for `cache.py`.
- Parser, IR, and emitter tests for CACHE, ON_FAIL, and fallback resolution.
- E2E test now validates that a second run within TTL produces zero `claude -p` invocations (verified via PATH-stub).

### Out of scope (planned for later)

`ON_FAIL` on `MODE: exact`, `CONFIDENCE`, `VALIDATE`, control-flow keywords (`FOR EACH`/`WHILE`/`IF`/`MATCH`), the optimizer, alternative emitter targets, NL → `.clio` frontend.

## v0.1.0 — 2026-05-03

First runnable slice. Compiles a strict subset of the CLIO language to a Claude Code project that runs end-to-end against `claude -p`.

### Language

- **Declarations**: `STEP`, `CONTRACT`, `FLOW`, `RESOURCES`
- **Step fields**: `TAKES`, `GIVES`, `MODE` (`exact` | `judgment`); duplicate fields rejected
- **Contract fields**: `SHAPE`, `ASSERT` (mini expression language: `len(x) > N`, `==`, `!=`, `>=`, `<=`, `>`, `<`, with literal int / float / str)
- **Types**: primitives (`int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`), `List<T>`, records `{f: T, ...}`, `enum(a|b|c)`, `str(max=N)`, `CSV` alias, contract refs by name
- **Flow**: sequential chain `->`, step calls with kwargs (string literals + state references)
- **Resources**: `target` (`claude-cli` only), `models` (first one becomes `claude -p --model`)

### Compiler

- Hand-written recursive-descent parser, frozen-dataclass AST and IR, single emitter for `claude-cli`. Zero LLM-framework dependencies.
- Inter-step type-checking on the FLOW chain.
- Errors carry `line:col` from the source.
- CLI: `python -m clio compile <source.clio> --target claude-cli --output <dir>` and `python -m clio check <source.clio>`.

### Emitted project

- `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/hooks.json` (placeholder), `contracts/<name>.schema.json`, `steps/NN_name.{py,prompt,schema.json}`, `clio_runtime/{validate,substitute}.py`, `state.json`, `run.sh`, `README.md`.
- `run.sh` orchestrator: bash, dynamic Python 3.12+ detection (override via `PYTHON=`), state passed via `state.json` + `jq`, judgment steps invoke `claude -p --model <model> --output-format text` with the schema inlined directly into the prompt; markdown code-fences are stripped from the response before validation.
- Contract validation: `jsonschema.Draft202012Validator` + the `referencing` library (no deprecated `RefResolver`); `x-clio-assert` is a closed JSON-AST evaluated by an explicit walker (no `eval`).

### Tests

- 61 unit + golden-file tests run by default.
- `tests/test_e2e.py` is gated by `CLIO_E2E=1` and exercises the full pipeline against a real `claude -p`. Manually verified.

### Out of scope (planned for later)

`MODE: auto`, `LANG: auto`, `CACHE`, `VALIDATE`, `ON_FAIL`, `CONFIDENCE`, `FOR EACH`, `WHILE`, `IF` / `ELSE`, `MATCH`, the optimizer (batching, model routing, context budget), other emitter targets (`python`, `docker`, `rust`, `hybrid`), the natural-language → `.clio` frontend, hooks-based validation. The parser rejects each of these explicitly with a clear "not yet supported in v0.1" error rather than silently ignoring.
